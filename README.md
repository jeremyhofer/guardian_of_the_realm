# Seven Thrones - Guardian of the Realm!

**_Seven Houses vie to control the Land. You have joined a House, and now you must begin the journey._**
**_The first House to control 7 Castles shall be declared the winner._**

## Background

Seven Thrones is the brainchild of Zorbaz Englander, an indie board game and video game developer getting
his start with his first major public project. Along with long time friend Jeremy Hofer (Fuego), the two
of us are working together to make this game a reality.

The aim of the game is simple - take control of the kingdom, securing control for your House. However,
this is no easy feat and 6 other Houses have the same goal. You must make friends, and enemies, within
your own House and with other Houses in order to have a chance to take control!

Currently the game is played on a Discord server, managed by the Guardian of the Realm (the bot whose
source is seen in this repo)! Long term we will be developing a full desktop version of the game, but
for now the bot has allowed us to grow interest and test game functionality.

## Come Play!

Please come check everything out, play, and get to know us and the others in the community!

## What is with this repo?

This repo contains the source code for the bot we have developed to manage and run Seven Thrones on our
Discord server. We're quite proud of the work we have put in and wanted to share the repo to:

1. market the game and ourselves
2. provide the open source community with an example of a game that can be made and ran in Discord and
   managed by a Discord bot

## Contributing and Issues?

As of now actual developers on the bot for the game are limited to Zorbaz and Fuego. However, we are
always looking for people to come and play and test the game, and provide feedback! Likewise issues
should be reported on the Discord server.

## Note on the source

Regarding the code - the source code here is very specific to being executing in our Discord server
currently. There are plans to update the source to be more flexible and allow for new instances to be
spun up and ran on other Discord servers whenever people who fork the code may desire. However, this is
not a chief development goal so work towards this is ad-hoc and as the improvements make sense for our
current development.
